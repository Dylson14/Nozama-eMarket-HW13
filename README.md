Nozama (amazon backwards) is an e-commerce app focused on gunning down the top competitors.

Project Description:
As a full-stack developer working with Nozama, I was tasked with building the back-end for our e-commerce site by modifying existing code. The important aspects of this project is to configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

Packages used:
- MySQL2
- Sequelize
