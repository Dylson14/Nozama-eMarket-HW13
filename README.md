# Nozama-eMarket-HW13
Welcome to Nozama (Amazon backwards), the giving the lead competition a run for its money. 

Description:
As a full-stack developer working for an e-commerce client, I have been tasked with developing the back-end for an e-commerce site by modifying pre-existing code. The major points are for me to configure a working Express.js API and to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

Packages used:
-MySQL2
-Sequelize
